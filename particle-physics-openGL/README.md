OpenCL/OpenGL Particle System

This project runs a particle system where particles follow gravity and rain down from a certain point given by a set velocity. There are two spheres on the way for some particles, and these particles bounce off. This system is meant to capture how well the GPU through OpenCL and OpenGL renders the particles.
